        "Python's `heapq` module provides an implementation of the heap queue algorithm, also known as the priority queue algorithm. It uses a regular Python list to maintain the heap invariant, meaning that for any given `k`, `heap[k]` has children at `2*k + 1` and `2*k + 2`, and `heap[k] <= heap[2*k + 1]` and `heap[k] <= heap[2*k + 2]`.
